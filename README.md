## Userstory 6

### Value Proposition

**As a** User,

- [ ] Add an `edit.js` in the `[id]` folder
- [ ] Create a page component in this file which reuses the form component for rendering the input fields
- [ ] If necessary, update the form component so that the current data of the attraction is already displayed as default values
- [ ] If necessary, update the form component to expect props like `onCancel`, `onSubmit`, `titleText`, `submitButtonText`
- [ ] Write a handleSubmit function which expects a submit event object
- [ ] Inside this function, send a `PATCH` request to the `api/places/[id]` api endpoint with the new place data in the body
- [ ] Update the api endpoint to handle `PATCH` requests
